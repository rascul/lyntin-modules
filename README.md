lyntin-modules
==============

my lyntin modules

* backslash - turn backslash into an alias for #raw

* idle - will one day be an anti idle thing for wotmud

* lyntinuser.py - my (currently empty) lyntinuser module

* repeatenter - enables the ability to repeat last command by hitting enter but
beware you can't use #cr with this so use #raw instead

* rooms - capture room name, description and exits and put them in variables
$room_name, $room_desc and $room_exits
